## Problem Motivation
The Department of Facilities (FAC) needs Parking & Vehicle Management Systems
(PVMS). The key objective of the system is efficient and clear administration of the
Universities Parking Bay Stock by:

* Recording of Parking Bay Stock indicating numbering, allocation status
and campus location
* Recording and processing current allocations and new applications for
parking bays
* Supplying the Finance Department with the correct information for
their parking bay rental accounts
* Recording allocated vehicle and user particulars against which parking
discs are issued.

The PVMS will include the registration of all cars (with or without allocated parking
bays), to better control and regulate vehicular access across campus. Completion of
registering of vehicles will allow the offices of FAC to issue parking discs.
You are required to design and implement (in Java) a program to manage the details
of a Parking & Vehicle Management Systems (PVMS).
